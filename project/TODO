Literally everything bahahahahaha

but to narrow down a little bit:

- Complete member class
- Create view to a request form for commission (use rails stuff to do this)
- Submit that data to the member in question
- Create member profile pages
- Submit a commission to another user
- Include links to sign in/log in (account creation)

Of lesser importance:

- give sellers options of posting plushes they made not through commissions
- maybe some simple forum for discussing plush-related issues? (help, commissions, chatter, etc)
